I shot these incense coils (or spirals) in the <a href="http://www.discoverhongkong.com/us/see-do/culture-heritage/chinese-temples/man-mo-temple.jsp">Man Mo Temple</a> in Sheung Wan, on Hong Kong island.

Photographers are explicitely authorized in this part of the temple as long as they don't bother the whorshipers.
