Children love to play. In every country, culture, home and continent, children play.

In the neighborhoods where old and worn out bicycle, motorbike, and vehicle tires can be found, they become a playing tool for the children. Regardless of the form and type of the tire used, it is no less amusing to see them endlessly propel the tire forward with any good stick.
