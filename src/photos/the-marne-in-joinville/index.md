The natural and cultural heritage form a coherent and preserved setting around the city. The valley of the Marne is hilly, oscillating between meadows in its bed and hillsides covered with forests. In Joinville, the Marne splits in two, with a reach that waters the old town. To this is added the canal. The natural setting thus provides a quality heritage ensemble.
