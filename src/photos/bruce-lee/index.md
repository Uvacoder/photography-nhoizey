The Hong Kong Bruce Lee Club raised US$100,000 for a statue to be erected after pleas to the government to honour his legacy. A 2.5 m (8.2 ft) bronze statue by artist Cao Chong-en was erected along the Avenue of Stars attraction near the waterfront at Tsim Sha Tsui. It shows a classic 'ready to strike' Bruce Lee pose, as seen in the 1972 movie Fist of Fury.
