The lakes in Amboseli National Park are seasonal and mainly located in the Western part of the park and usually fill up during the rainy season.

The shores of these lakes are covered with papyrus and are frequented by many species of aquatic birds both resident and migratory.

Flamingos, once almost absent in the park, are increasingly present, especially during the dry season; they can be easily spotted in the shallow water and alkaline lakes while feeding.
