<h2>Welcome to my photography portfolio!</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m a French self-taught amateur photographer. I like shooting both <a href="/nature/">nature</a> and <a href="/urban/">urban</a> scenery, <a href="/portraits/">portraits</a>, and wild <a href="/animals/">animals</a>. I also love to travel to discover new <a href="/locations/">locations</a>.</p>
<p>Here are my latest photos:</p>

{% from "macros/photo.njk" import photo %}

<ul class="gallery">
  {% for item in collections.photos | limit(6) %}
    {{ photo(item) }}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
