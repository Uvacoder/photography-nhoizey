<h2>Welcome to my photography portfolio!</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m a French self-taught amateur photographer. I love to <a href="/travels/">travel</a> to discover new horizons and people, shooting both <a href="/wanderings/nature/">nature</a> and <a href="/wanderings/urban/">urban</a> scenery, and taking <a href="/portraits/">portraits</a>.</p>
<p>Here are my latest photos:</p>

  {% for item in collections.photos | limit(6) %}
    {{ photo(item) }}
  {% endfor %}
