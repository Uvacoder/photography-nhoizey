The Four Thirds System is a standard created by Olympus and Eastman Kodak for digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLR) and mirrorless cameras. Unlike older single-lens reflex (SLR) systems, Four Thirds was designed from the start to be entirely digital.

In August 2008, Olympus and Panasonic introduced a new format, [Micro Four Thirds](/tags/micro-four-thirds/).
