The Micro Four Thirds system is a standard released by Olympus and Panasonic in 2008, for the design and development of mirrorless interchangeable lens digital cameras.

It shares the original image sensor size and specification with the [Four Thirds](/tags/four-thirds/) system designed for DSLRs, but does not provide space for a mirror box and a pentaprism, which facilitates smaller body and lens designs via the shorter flange focal distance.
